# hello-world

Hi all!
My name is Dolapo and I am an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am a triple degree student majoring in Computer Science, Linguistics - Grammars and Cognition, and Classics - Latin and Greek. 

I hope to one day be a pioneer in AI, particularly in the realms of HCI and NLP.

I anticipate two master's degrees. One is a dual program in Computer Science and Computational Linguistics, the other in Cognitive Science.

I also plan on going on to law school, where I'd like to focus on Constitutional Law, particularly First Amendment Constitutional Law. 

Lastly, I intend to receive a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligenc and Symbolic Systems.

My favorite pastimes are eating and sleeping. My capacity to do both amazes me!
